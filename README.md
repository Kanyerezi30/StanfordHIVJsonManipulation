# Description

This is a repo for manipulating the Stanford HIV Json outputs to a Json format that can be interrogated by the LIMS to give a clinician only information that they need. 

This has been specifically tailored for JCRC. In case of any challenges or in need of a different format or any other kind of formatting, contact the developers whose contacts are in the contact section
